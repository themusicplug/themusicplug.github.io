* ThrillseekerVBL (!!!!!!!!!!! cannot emphasise enough how fucking incredible this is, it’s goddamn analogue magic in a box !!!!!!!!!!!!)
* NastyDLA mkII (hands down the best free delay VST - not the lightest but great sounding)
* NastyVCS

* BootsEQ mkII
* BaxterEQ 
* epicVerb (excellent-sounding reverb)
* TesslaPRO mkII
* ThrillseekerXTC
* ThrillseekerLA

* Phuturetone Philteroid - A Sherman Filterbank clone, and it works pretty well for mangling your sounds!
* Phuturetone Phutura - Alpha Juno-type synth. Solid synth, notably it does Hoover sounds. 

* SQ8L - model of SQ80 wavetable synth, very 80s, sounds wonderful
* Charlatan - Flexible, lightweight subtractive synth. Good workhorse
* WOK Plugins - a whole host of great Win32 VSTs here, including a free Shimmer reverb! It’s Donationware for personal reasons of the author

Win32/64 but OSX-32 only

* TAL Dub (I & II - phenomenal dubby delays that work to enhance everything I do. very light, too. Ignore mkIII, it loses the vintage charm and clean delays can be done by stock plugins)
* TAL U-NO 62 (a free, quality Juno-type synth)
* Synth1 - a classic for a reason. excellent range of features with a solid 90s sound
Win/OSX fully compatible

Synths/instruments:
* ObxD - quality Oberheim-type synth, excellent subtractive workhorse
* Dexed - DX7-style FM synth, a bit complicated but 1:1 compatibility with DX7 patches and works great, so a lot of possibilities there
* TAL Nois3maker - Great VA synth, some FM, some modulation detail, great for a lot of tasks
* u-he TyrellN6 - Well-known, based on Juno, excellent sound, slightly finicky
* u-he Podolski - VA synth that really comes into its own with Boards of Canada-style pads and leads
     —> example of Podolski (and Tyrell for the arp) in use: https://clyp.it/uh54ordn?token=b62ba71529f04b098d207d81f5b21fe8
* u-he Zebralette - Small, but great-sounding wavetable synth that has plenty of options to mess with the wave shape
* PG-8X - Roland JX-8P emulation. Not perfect, but decent
* Grace - decent sampler
* Sforzando - Great .sfz sampler if you have instruments in that format
* Hyova audio Ribs - absolutely insane granular sampler. Has no feature to save the audio it captures to use at the moment, but the stuff it comes up with is incredibly creative, and it’s in a very nice UI.


Effects:

* TAL Reverb 4 - the freeware reverb I use ALL the time. Top notch quality, enough controls to set

Creative effects: 
* dblue Glitch - that tape stop you heard in every EDM song, but with way more capabilities. basic step sequenced glitch effects, despite some limitations hugely useful
* Glitchmachines Hysteresis - Glitchy modulated delay. Fantastic for industrial / experimental music and sound design
* Glitchmachines Fracture - primarily a buffer glitch plugin, similar applications to Hysteresis. Those two are a beast for creating spooky and otherworldly sounds
* Audiothing Filterjam - Creative filter/mod effects, really useful to change a sound
